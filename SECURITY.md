# Security Policy

We take security seriously.

## Supported versions
This project is pre-1.0; we patch `main` actively and cut tags for demos.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please email **forrybg.hh@gmail.com** with:
- Impact summary
- Steps to reproduce
- PoC / logs
We will acknowledge within 5 business days and coordinate a fix/credit.

## Do not
- Disclose publicly before we confirm and release a fix.
- Include real secrets or personal data in reports.

## Cryptography note
Demo keys/certs are for testing only. Production deployments must generate
fresh keys and follow the PKI playbook in `docs/`.
