# Cover Letter – ForiTech Secure System

To Whom It May Concern,

We are pleased to submit our proposal for the ForiTech Secure System under the Digital Europe Programme. This project addresses a critical need for scalable, privacy-respecting cybersecurity solutions tailored to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across the European Union.

ForiTech Secure System combines modular SIEM architecture, secure vaulting, and Web3 licensing mechanisms to empower SMEs with enterprise-grade protection. The system is designed to be GDPR-compliant, cost-efficient, and deployable without complex infrastructure.

Our team brings together experienced developers, security engineers, analysts, and external legal and accounting support. The project is structured for long-term sustainability, with a clear post-grant commercial model, open-source contributions, and SME partnerships already in place.

We believe this initiative aligns strongly with the goals of the Digital Decade and contributes to Europe’s digital sovereignty and resilience. We thank you for considering our application and remain available for any further information or clarification.

Sincerely,  
Hristofor H.
