**Technology Readiness Level (TRL): 5â€“6**

The Fori Tech Secure System is currently at TRL level 5â€“6, based on the European Commission's TRL scale.

### âœ… TRL 5 â€“ Technology validated in relevant environment
- Core components such as Vault, MinIO, Keycloak, and VPN are developed and tested in controlled environments.
- Web3 authentication and NFT licensing mechanisms are functional in prototype form.

### âœ… TRL 6 â€“ Technology demonstrated in relevant environment
- Integration of SIEM tools (Wazuh, Suricata) and AI-based log analysis is underway.
- The system has been deployed internally for testing and validation with simulated data.

### ðŸ“Œ Next Steps:
- Finalize Web UI and NFT engine
- Conduct pilot deployment with 3â€“5 SMEs
- Optimize performance and security based on real-world feedback

This TRL declaration confirms that the project is mature enough for deployment and funding, yet still in need of support for full implementation and scaling.
